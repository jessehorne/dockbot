# What is DockBot?
DockBot gives users in your Discord server access to the Endless Seas, a watery realm with all the piratey goodness. DockBot was inspired by DankMemer but quickly turned into it's own unique bot with a boat-y twist. With DockBot, your users will sail the seas in search for treasure, gamble their earnings and face their opponents in epic text-based action. Just watch out for the Royal Navy!

### Featuring...

## A help menu

# How to Play
Since DockBot is so early in development, it's only on my server. Get in touch with me if you'd like to give it a try on yours. For now, please join **Dock's Dev Dinghy** to play. There's dedicated channels to play and you can also DM DockBot if you want to be more private.
